<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">P</span>OISON-IVY, poison-oak, and poison sumac remind
most people of painful experiences to be avoided,
yet many do not know any one of the offending plants
or their equally poisonous relatives. Learning to recognize
them on sight is relatively easy, especially by
examining the distinctive identifying characters described
in the pictures and legends of this bulletin.
There is then a good chance to avoid them or, if one
must work among them, to take preventive measures
to escape poisoning.</p>

<p>These plants are very common throughout the
United States. They are found in fields and woods,
along fence rows, rock walls, and hedges, in lawns and
gardens, and even sometimes vining on houses. Usually
in any one locality it is necessary to be certain of
the identity of only two or three of them. Maps show
at a glance where they are likely to be found. Frequent
observation and recognition of the plants as
they are encountered almost daily is the best way to
become poison-oak or poison-ivy conscious. Nonpoisonous
sumacs are easily distinguished from the
poisonous species by the seed heads and leaves.</p>

<p>The old proverb, &ldquo;an ounce of prevention is worth
a pound of cure,&rdquo; is good advice to everyone, particularly
as regards ivy-poisoning. Previous escape is not
proof of immunity when conditions are right, and
after poisoning occurs there is no quick cure known.
Some relief may be obtained and recovery hastened
by use of some of the tested remedies. In case of
severe poisoning a physician should be consulted.</p>

<p>Poison-ivy and other poisonous plants growing in
grounds frequented by people should be eradicated.
In some places this can be done by careful grubbing.
In others weed-killing chemicals may be better and
more certainly would avert poisoning for most of us.</p>

<div class="dropcap">E</div>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">E</span>VERY year sees many adults, and especially children, accidentally
poisoned from contact with plants that they did not know
were harmful. Had the sufferers known how to detect poisonous
plants they could have avoided them and escaped the painful experience
of severe skin inflammations and water blisters. Very few
persons have a sufficient degree of immunity to protect them from
poisonous plants, and many do not recognize them in the various
forms that they assume in different parts of the country.</p>

<p>One or more kinds of poison-ivy&mdash;common poison-ivy, oakleaf
poison-ivy, and western poison-oak&mdash;occur in abundance in almost
every part of the United States. Poison sumac is of more limited
distribution and occurs chiefly east of the Mississippi River, usually
in swampy regions.</p>

<p>Poisoning by these plants is largely preventable. A knowledge
sufficient to identify them in their various forms is easily gained by
anyone who will make a study of pictures and general descriptions
and train himself by a little diligent practice to observe the plants
in his locality. It is important to become poison-oak or poison-ivy
conscious. This can be accomplished only by learning to know the
plants by repeated experience in observing them in their various
forms. Persons who learn both to know and to avoid the plants can
save themselves much inconvenience and discomfort. The simple
means of learning to recognize them will pay big dividends. It is
the first step to the prevention of poisoning and to the eradication
of the pests from private grounds and public places.</p>

<p>The most effective method of prevention is to eradicate the plants,
and wherever possible this should be done. They should not be
allowed to grow in lawns or gardens, with ornamental shrubbery, or
on houses. Communities should not countenance the growth of poison-ivy
or poison-oak in school grounds, on public roadways, or in parks,
especially those frequented by children. The cost of medical aid for
one season in treating pupils using an ivy-infested schoolyard is likely
to be more than that of eradicating the plants, to say nothing of the
suffering and inconvenience they may cause.</p>

<h2><a name="FORMS_OF_POISON-IVY_AND_POISON-OAK" id="FORMS_OF_POISON-IVY_AND_POISON-OAK">FORMS OF POISON-IVY AND POISON-OAK</a></h2>


<p>Poison-ivy and poison-oak are known by a number of local names,
and several different kinds of plants are called by these names. The
plants exhibit a good deal of variation throughout the United States,
so much so that even technical botanists cannot agree on the number
of species and names that should be applied to them. They grow
in the form of (1) woody vines attached to trees or objects for support,
(2) trailing shrubs mostly on the ground, or (3) erect woody
shrubs entirely without support. They may flourish in the deep
woods, where soil moisture is plentiful, or they may be found in
very dry soil on the most exposed hillsides. The plants are most
frequently abundant along old fence rows and edges of paths and
roadways, and they ramble over rock walls and climb posts or trees
to considerable heights. They often grow with other shrubs or vines
in such ways as to escape notice.</p>

<p>The leaf forms among plants or even on the same plant are as
variable as the habit of growth; however, the leaves always consist
of three leaflets. The old saying, &ldquo;Leaflets three, let it be,&rdquo; is a
reminder of this consistent leaf character but may lead to undue suspicion
of some harmless plant. Only one three-parted leaf leads off
from each node on the stem. The leaves never occur in pairs along
the stem. The wide range in habit of growth of plants and leaf
types may be noted from a glance at the several pictures of plants
and leaves.</p>

<p>The flowers and fruit are always in clusters on slender stems that
originate in the axis of the leaves along the side of the smaller
branches. The fruits usually have a white, waxy appearance and
ordinarily are not hairy, but may be so in some forms. The plants
do not always flower and bear fruit. The white or cream-colored
clusters of fruit, when they occur, are significant identifying characters,
especially at the season after the leaves have fallen.</p>

<p>For convenience, these plants are discussed in this bulletin under
three divisions: (1) Common poison-ivy, (2) oakleaf poison-ivy, and
(3) Western poison-oak. A technical botanist would recognize many
species of plants in what are included as the common poison-ivy, and
anyone will recognize that various forms occur within this grouping.</p>

<h3><a id="COMMON_POISON-IVY" name="COMMON_POISON-IVY"></a>COMMON POISON-IVY</h3>

<p>Some form of the common
poison-ivy may be
found in almost every part
of the country but the extreme
West. The shaded
area on the map in <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>
shows the extensive range
where some form of poison-ivy
is likely to be found.
The plant is known by various
local names&mdash;poison-ivy,
threeleaf ivy, poison
creeper, climbing sumac,
poison-oak, markweed, piery, and mercury. The most widespread
form is classified by botanists under the botanical name of <i>Rhus radicans</i>
or varieties of it; however, many of the variations are sometimes
given other botanical names. The common poison-ivy may
be considered as a vine in its most typical growth habit.</p>

the edge of a lawn. <i>B</i>, Typical vine, showing leaves and the roots that
attach it to the tree.</div>
</div>

<p>The vining type most often occurs in wooded areas (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>), where
it depends upon trees for support. Vines often grow for many
years, becoming several inches in diameter and quite woody. Slender
vines may run along the ground, mixed with shrubbery, or take support
from a large or small tree. That a plant growing along the edge
of a lawn and into the shrubbery may be quite inconspicuous as compared
with a vine climbing on a lawn tree is shown in <a href="#fig3">figure 3</a>.
The vine readily develops roots when in contact with the ground or
with any object that will support it. When the vines grow on trees
these aerial roots attach the vine securely (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3. B</a>). A rank growth
of these roots often causes the vines on trees to have the general appearance
of a &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; rope, which sometimes serves a good purpose
for identification. The vines and roots apparently do not cause
injury to the tree except where growth may be sufficient to cover the
supporting plant and exclude sunlight or break the plant from excessive
weight. The vining nature of the plant makes it well adapted
to climbing over stone walls or on brick and stone houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that poison-ivy
often becomes mixed
in with ornamental
shrubbery and vines
often results in its cultivation
as an ornamental
vine by people who
do not recognize the
plant. An ivy plant
growing on a house, as is
shown in <a href="#fig4">figure 4</a>, is
often prized by an unsuspecting
owner. The
vine is attractive and
quite effective as an ornamental,
but such use
should not be tolerated,
as it most certainly will
result in cases of accidental
poisoning and
serve as propagating
stock for more poison-ivy
in the vicinity.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><i>Figure 4.</i>&mdash;Common poison-ivy

</div>

<p>When poison-ivy becomes
mixed in with
other vines it is quite
difficult to detect except
by one who has carefully
trained himself in observing
and recognizing the
plant. Also, some other
vines and young plants resemble
poison-ivy in many
respects. The Virginia
creeper and some forms of
the Boston ivy are often
confused with it. The Virginia
creeper can always be
recognized by its five leaflets
radiating from one
point of attachment, as
compared with the three
leaflets of poison-ivy arranged
in the same manner.
The Boston ivy with three
leaflets is sometimes difficult
to detect; however, as a
rule not all the leaves on the plant will be divided into three leaflets.
By studying a large number of the leaves it is usually possible to
detect on every Boston ivy plant some leaves that have only one
deeply lobed blade or leaflet, while the poison-ivy always has the three
leaflets. A number of other plants are easily confused with poison-ivy.
No specific rule can be observed that will easily rule out all
possibility of confusion. The best policy is to learn through practiced
observation to know poison-ivy on sight and then to make the
determination from observation of all parts of the plant, and never
to judge from a single leaf or part.</p>

</div>

<p>Common poison-ivy in full sunlight along fence rows or in open
fields grows more in the form of a shrub than a vine. In some localities
the common form is a low-growing shrub from 6 to 30 inches in
height. This form, as well as the vining type, usually has a rather
extensive horizontal system of rootstocks or stems at or just below
the ground level. The vining form under some conditions later becomes
a shrub. Plants of this type are shown in <a href="#fig5">figure 5</a>, where the
vine, supported on the fence, has extended upright stems that
are shrublike. In some localities the growth form over a wide range
is consistently either a vine or a shrub type, while in others what
seems to be the same species may produce either vines or shrubs.</p>

<p>The leaves of the common poison-ivy are extremely variable, the
three leaflets being the only constant character. It is impossible to
describe the great range of variation in the shape or lobing of the
leaflets. A study of the leaf patterns, especially the six shown in
<a href="#fig6">figure 6</a>, will give a fair range of types, although other forms may be
found. One plant may have a large variety of forms of leaves or it
may have all leaves of about the same general character. The most
common type of leaf having leaflets with even margins is shown in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
<a href="#fig6">figure 6, <i>D</i></a>, and one with
leaflets having slightly
lobed margins is shown in
<a href="#fig6">figure 6, <i>E</i></a>. The other
forms shown in <a href="#fig6">figure 6</a> are

may be the usual type
throughout some areas.</p>

</div>

<p>Most of the vines or
shrubs of poison-ivy produce
some flowers that are
always in clusters arising
on the side of the stem
immediately above a leaf.
The flowers are rather inconspicuous
among the
leaves, as may be noted in
<a href="#fig7">figure 7</a>, but they are in
quite distinct clusters, as
shown in <a href="#fig8">figure 8, <i>A</i></a>. Frequently
the flowers do not
develop or are abortive and
no fruit is produced. When
fruits do develop they serve
as a positive way of identifying
the plant. The berries
are not easily confused
with the fruits of other
plants. They are white and
waxy in appearance and
have rather distinct lines
marking the outer surface,
as the segments appear in a
peeled orange. These lines
may be noted in <a href="#fig8">figure 8, <i>B</i></a>,
which shows dense clusters
of mature fruit about natural
size. Some forms of the
poison-ivy have the fruit covered
with fine hair, giving it a kind of
downy appearance; however, in
the more common form the fruits
are entirely smooth. The fruit is
especially helpful in identifying
plants late in fall, in winter, and
early in spring, when the leaves
are not present.</p>

<h3><a id="OAKLEAF_POISON-IVY" name="OAKLEAF_POISON-IVY"></a>OAKLEAF POISON-IVY</h3>

<p>Of the several kinds of poison-ivy,
the oakleaf form occurring in
the Eastern and Southern States
is more distinctive than some
other types. Some people know it
as oakleaf ivy while others call it
poison-oak, a name more commonly
used for the western species
discussed later. Botanists have
not always agreed upon the scientific
name to be applied to this
form; however, they now use the
name <i>Rhus toxicodendron</i>. Some
botanists have used the Latin
names <i>R. quercifolia</i>, while others
used the name <i>Toxicodendron
quercifolium</i>, both of which are
more descriptive of the oakleaf
form, as the generic name of the
oak is <i>Quercus</i>. The area where
the oakleaf form may occur, from
New Jersey to Texas, is outlined
in the map shown in <a href="#fig9">figure 9</a>. The
common poison-ivy also occurs in
some form throughout many parts
of this same area.</p>

<p>The oakleaf poison-ivy usually
does not climb as a vine, but
occurs as a low-growing shrub.
Stems are usually upright in their
general growth habit, as they
appear in <a href="#fig10">figure 10</a>. The shrubs
usually have rather slender
branches, often covered with a fine
pubescence that gives the plant a
kind of downy appearance. The
leaflets occur in threes, as in other ivy, but are lobed, somewhat on
the general plan of the leaves of some kinds of oak. The middle
leaflet usually is lobed somewhat alike on both margins and very much
resembles a small oak leaf, while the two lateral leaflets are often
irregularly lobed. The leaves shown in <a href="#fig11">figure 11</a> are a common form.
The lighter color on the under side of one of the leaves (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11, <i>A</i></a>)
is due to the pubescence, or fine hairs, on the surface. The range in
size of leaves varies considerably, even on the same plant; the leaf
shown in <a href="#fig11">figure 11, <i>B</i></a>, however, is about natural size.</p>

<p>The fruit of oakleaf poison-ivy has the same general appearance
as the fruit of common poison-ivy shown in <a href="#fig8">figure 8</a>, although the
individual fruits and stems are often pubescent, while most of the
other forms have a waxy, smooth, cream-colored fruit.</p>

<h3><a id="WESTERN_POISON-OAK" name="WESTERN_POISON-OAK"></a>WESTERN POISON-OAK</h3>

<p>The western poison-oak (<i>Rhus diversiloba</i>) of the Pacific Coast
States is usually known as poison-oak, but is occasionally referred
to as poison-ivy or yeara.
It is likely to be found
in the region designated
by shading in <a href="#fig12">figure 12</a>,
and from central Oregon
northward through
Washington may be growing
intermixed with common
poison-ivy. The term
&ldquo;poison-oak&rdquo; is a misnomer,
as this species is
in no way related to the
oak but is related to
poison-ivy. Anyone familiar
with either of these
plants in their several
forms will likely recognize
the other, both as
plants to be avoided.</p>

<p>The most common
growth habit of the western
poison-oak is in the
form of a
rank upright
shrub with
many small woody stems rising
from the ground. It frequently
grows in great abundance along
roadsides (see <a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>) and in uncultivated
fields or on abandoned
land.</p>

<p>Sometimes western poison-oak
attaches itself to upright objects
for support and takes more or less
the form of a vine. A plant of this
type is shown in <a href="#fig13">figure 13</a>, where
it is growing on a telephone pole
by the roadside. It may be noted
even in this case that the tendency
is for individual branches to continue
an upright growth rather
than become entirely dependent
upon other objects for support. In
some areas, especially in woodland,
poison-oak may grow principally
as a vine. Areas have been noted
where 70 to 80 percent of the trees
leaves and flowers.
in a wooded area support
vines running more than
25 or 30 feet in height,
although the most common
form of the plant is
the shrub.</p>

<p>In open pasture fields western poison-oak usually grows in spreading
clumps from a few feet to several feet tall (figs. <a href="#fig14">14</a> and <a href="#fig16">16</a>).
Where it develops extensively it greatly reduces the area for grazing
and becomes a serious menace to most people who frequent the area

<p>Low-growing plants, especially
those exposed to full sunlight, are
often quite woody and show no
tendency for vining. Low-growing
plants with woody stems are
common in pasture areas or along
roadsides. Livestock in grazing
do not invade the poison-ivy
shrub, and as a rule these plants

<p>As in other ivy the leaves consist
of three leaflets with much
irregularity in the manner of lobing,
especially of the two lateral
leaflets. The Latin name <i>dirersiloba</i>
refers to the irregularity occurring in the shapes of the leaves on
different plants and on the same plant or even irregularity in the
lobing of leaflets of the same leaf. Sometimes lobes occur on both
sides of a leaflet, thus giving it somewhat the semblance of an oak
leaf. The middle or terminal leaflet is more likely to be lobed on
both sides and resembles an oak leaf more than the other two. A study
of the leaves shown in figures <a href="#fig15">15</a> and <a href="#fig17">17</a> shows the variation in lobing.
Some plants may have leaflets with an even margin and no lobing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
whatsoever, as those in <a href="#fig15">figure 15, <i>B</i></a>. The surface of the leaves is
usually glossy and uneven, so that they have a thick leathery
appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span></p>

<p>The flowers are borne in clusters on slender stems diverging from
the axis of the leaf, as may be noted in <a href="#fig17">figure 17</a>, <i>C</i>. The individual
flowers are greenish white and about one-fourth inch across. The
cluster of flowers matures into greenish or creamy-white berrylike
fruits about mid-October. These are about the size of small currants
and are much like other poison-ivy
fruits, having a smooth
greenish-white glossy surface
striped somewhat like the segments
of a peeled orange. Many
plants bear no fruit, although
others produce it in abundance, as
shown in <a href="#fig18">figure 18, <i>A</i></a>. The fruits
are not always spherical, but
sometimes have a somewhat flattened
appearance, as is shown in
<a href="#fig18">figure 18, <i>B</i></a>. They remain on the
plants throughout fall and winter
and are quite helpful in identifying
poison-oak in seasons after the
leaves have fallen.</p>

<p>Poison sumac grows as a coarse
woody shrub or small tree (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>)
and never in the vinelike form of its poison-ivy relatives. This
plant is known also as swamp sumac, poison elder, poison ash, poison
dogwood, and thunderwood. It does not have variable forms, such
as occur in poison-oak or poison-ivy, and botanists agree to call it
<i>Rhus vernix</i>. The area in the Eastern States where it is likely to be
found is chiefly eastward from eastern Minnesota, northeastern
Illinois, Indiana, central Kentucky and Tennessee, and southeastern
Texas, as shown on the shaded area of the map, <a href="#fig20">figure 20</a>. This

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span></p>

<p>The plants range in
height from 5 or 6 feet
to small trees that may
attain a height of 25 feet.
The poison sumac shrub
shown in <a href="#fig19">figure 19</a> is
growing on the edge of a
swamp and is quite typical
of the general appearance
of the larger
shrubs, which approach
a treelike form. As a
rule the shrubs do not
have a symmetrical upright
treelike appearance.
They are more or
less inclined to lean and
have branched stems
with about the same diameter
from the ground
level to the middle
height of the shrub.</p>

<p>Occasional isolated
plants are found outside
of swampy regions. Apparently
these plants are
started from seed distributed
by birds. The
plants in dry soil usually
do not become more than
a few feet tall. They are
likely to cause poisoning
to unsuspecting individuals,
as single isolated
plants are not readily
recognized, especially
out of their usual region.</p>

<p>The leaves of the poison
sumac are divided
into 7 to 13 leaflets, arranged
in pairs with a
single leaflet at the end
of the midrib (<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span></p>

<p>The leaflets are an elongated oval shape without teeth or serrations
on the margins. They are 3 to 4 inches long and 1 to 2 inches
wide, with a smooth velvetlike texture and bright orange color when
they first appear in spring. Later they become dark green and
glossy on the upper surface and pale green on the lower and have
scarlet midribs. Early in fall they turn to a brilliant red-orange
or russet shade.</p>

<p>The small yellowish-green flowers are borne in clusters in slender
stems arising from the axis of leaves along the smaller branches.
The slender clusters of flowers have much the general appearance of
the poison-ivy flower, but hang in much longer clusters. The flowers
mature into ivory-white or green-colored fruits resembling those of
poison-oak or poison-ivy, except that they are usually less compact
and hang in loose clusters that may be 10 to 12 inches in length
(<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>).</p>

<h3><a id="CONFUSION" name="CONFUSION"></a>CONFUSION OF POISONOUS AND HARMLESS SUMACS</h3>

<p>Because of the same general appearance of several common species
of sumac and the poison sumac, considerable confusion has occurred
as to which one is poisonous. Throughout most of the range where
poison sumac grows, three other species are the only ones that are
likely to be confused. These are the smooth sumac (<i>Rhus glabra</i>),
staghorn sumac (<i>R. typhina</i>), and dwarf sumac (<i>R. copallina</i>). All
the nonpoisonous species have red fruits that together form a distinctive
terminal seed head, as shown in <a href="#fig23">figure 23</a>. These are easily
distinguished from the slender hanging clusters of white fruit of
the poison sumac, as shown in <a href="#fig22">figure 22</a>. Sometimes more than one
species of the harmless sumac grow together, as shown in <a href="#fig23">figure 23, <i>A</i></a>.</p>

<p>When seed heads or flower heads occur on the plants it is easy to
distinguish the poisonous from the harmless plants; however, in
many clumps of either kind, flowers or fruit may not develop. Fortunately,
the leaves have some rather distinct characteristics, which
can be easily observed. <a href="#fig24">Figure 24</a> shows leaves of the three harmless
species as compared with poison sumac.</p>

<p>The leaves of the smooth sumac (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24, <i>A</i></a>) and of the staghorn
sumac (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24, <i>B</i></a>) have many leaflets, which are slender lance-shaped
with a toothed margin. In these species there are usually more than
13 leaflets. The leaves of the dwarf sumac (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24, <i>C</i></a>) and the poison
sumac (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24, <i>D</i></a>) have fewer leaflets, and these are more oval-shaped,
with smooth or even margins.</p>

<p>The dwarf sumac, however, may be readily distinguished from
the poisonous sumac by the winged midrib of the leaf (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24, <i>E</i></a>).
There is considerable variation in the size of the wing margin along
the midrib, which in some cases may be reduced almost to a line
between the leaflets. The winged midrib is more prominent near
the terminal leaflet and can always be detected. The midrib of the
poison sumac is never winged. A little study of the fruit and the
leaf characteristics of the poisonous and harmless species will make
it possible to avoid the poisonous one and utilize the other, which
has considerable value as an ornamental plant, as a source of commercial
tannin, and for controlling erosion on waste hillsides.</p>

<h3><a id="INTRODUCED" name="INTRODUCED"></a>INTRODUCED POISONOUS SUMAC AND RELATED SPECIES</h3>

<p>The small Japanese lacquer-tree, although uncommon in the
United States, is an introduced species of sumac (<i>Rhus verniciflua</i>)
that is quite similar to the native poison sumac. It is native to Japan
and China and is the source of Japanese black lacquer. Cases of
poisoning hare been traced to contact with lacquered articles. Because
of its poisonous properties, this tree should never be planted.</p>

<p>A native shrub or small tree called poison-wood, doctor gum, or
coral sumac is commonly found in the pinelands and hummocks of
extreme southern Florida, the Keys, and the West Indies. It is much
like the poison sumac and closely related to it. Most botanists name
it <i>Metopium toxiferum</i>, although previously it was named <i>Rhus
metopium</i>, and sometimes metopium is used as its common name.
The small tree, or shrub, has the same general appearance as poison
sumac. The leaves have the same general appearance, except that
there are usually only three to seven leaflets, which are more rounded.
The fruits are borne in clusters in the same manner as those of
poison sumac (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>), but individual fruits are two or three times
as large and orange-colored. All parts of the plant are exceedingly
poisonous to the touch and cause the same kind of skin irritation as
poison-ivy or poison sumac.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="POISONING" id="POISONING">POISONING</a></h2>


<p>Through experience, many people know that they are susceptible
to poisoning by poison-ivy, poison-oak, or poison sumac, while some
others either have escaped contamination or have a certain degree of
immunity. The extent of immunity appears only relative, and absolute
immunity to the toxic principle apparently does not exist.
Persons who have shown a degree of immunity upon repeated contact
with the plants may develop poisoning on subsequent exposure.</p>

<p>The skin irritant of poison-ivy, poison-oak, and poison sumac is
the same toxic agent. It is a nonvolatile phenolic substance called
urushiol and is found in all parts of the plant, including roots and
fruit. It occurs in great abundance in the plant sap. The danger of
poisoning is greatest in spring and summer, when the sap is abundant,
and least late in fall or in winter.</p>

<p>Poisoning is usually caused by contact with some part of the plant.
A very small quantity of the poisonous substance is capable of producing
severe inflammation of the skin and can easily be transferred
from one object to another. Clothing may become contaminated and
is often a source of such prolonged infection that it is likely to be
judged as a case of poisoning difficult to cure. Dogs and cats frequently
touch the plants and transmit the poison to unsuspecting
persons. The poison may remain on the fur of animals for a considerable
period after they have walked or run through poison-ivy
plants. Smoke from burning plants will carry the toxin and has been
reported to cause severe cases of poisoning. Cases of poisoning of
children from eating the fruit have been reported. A local belief that
eating a few leaves of these plants will develop immunity in the individual
is unfounded. It never should be attempted. No part of
the plant should ever be taken internally, as it is a violent irritant
and poisonous to man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span></p>

<p>Cattle, horses, sheep, hogs, and other livestock apparently do not
suffer from skin irritation caused by these plants, although they have
been observed to graze upon the foliage occasionally. Bees collect
honey from the flowers, though no reports are on record of any ill
effects from the use of the honey.</p>

<p>The time between contamination of the skin and the first symptoms
varies greatly with individuals and probably with conditions. The
first symptoms of itching or burning sensation may develop in a few
hours or after 5 days or even more. The delay in development of
symptoms is often confusing in attempting to determine the time or
location when contamination occurred. The itching sensation and
subsequent inflammation, which usually develops into water blisters
under the skin, may continue for several days from a single contamination.
Persistence of symptoms over a long period is likely to
be due to new contacts with plants or with previously contaminated
clothing or animals. Severe infection may produce more serious
symptoms, which result in much pain through abscesses, enlarged
glands, fever, or complicated constitutional malfunction. Secondary
infections are always a possibility in any break in the skin, such as is
produced by breaking vesicles that have formed as large water
blisters.</p>


<h3><a id="PRECAUTIONS" name="PRECAUTIONS"></a>PRECAUTIONS AGAINST POISONING</h3>

<p>The most effective way to prevent poisoning from the plants is to
avoid contact with them. If it is necessary to work among them,
some measure of prevention can be gained by wearing protective
clothing, but it is necessary to remember that the active poisonous
principle can easily be transferred. Some protection also may be
obtained in advance by the use of protective creams or lotions. They
prevent the poison from touching the skin, or make the active principle
easily removed, or neutralize it to a certain degree.</p>

<p>Various formulas containing ferric chloride and glycerin have
been used more or less effectively as a preventive measure, although
there may be some danger of pigmentation of the skin from the ferric
chloride. A common formula is ferric chloride, 5 parts; glycerin,
25 parts; alcohol, 25 parts; water. 50 parts.</p>

<p>A lotion of this formula applied to the exposed skin prior to contact
with poisonous plants gives effective protection for many people.
It is especially effective if followed by thorough washing with soap
and water. Such washing, even if no protective lotion has been used,
is often effective in preventing poisoning. Proper precaution should
be taken by repeated lathering with a strong alkali soap, followed
by thorough rinsing and repeating the process several times. The
water should be frequently changed, and a shower or flowing water
bath is preferable. The soap probably only emulsifies the active
principle, and thorough rinsing is necessary to avoid spreading the
poison to other parts of the body.</p>

<p>The United States Public Health Service reports successful chemical
protection against ivy poisoning by use of an oxidizing agent&mdash;sodium
perborate prepared and used fresh as an ointment. Following
is a formula given for the ointment: Cetyl alcohol, 35.1 percent;
stearyl alcohol, 5.3; ceresin, 3.5; castor oil. 20.8; mineral oil, 21.9;
Duponol WA pure, 1.7; sodium perborate. 10.0; and boric acid, 1.7
percent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span></p>

<p>A more recent less oily formula recommended for both mechanical
and chemical protection is given as follows: Shellac, 13 parts;
isopropanol, 31; linseed oil, 4; titanium oxide, 12; sodium perborate,
13; talcum, 20; and carbitol, 3 parts.</p>

<p>Sometimes cottonseed oil, olive oil, or petrolatum is applied as a
protective ointment when contamination is anticipated. Later the
oil must be completely removed by repeated washing.</p>

<p>Clothing, wearing apparel, and tools that have been contaminated
are often difficult to handle without further danger of poisoning.
Some who are more or less immune to poisoning often contaminate
others by carelessness. Contamination on automobile door handles
or on a steering wheel after a trip to the woods often causes prolonged
cases of poisoning of persons who have not been near the plants.
One of the most effective ways for decontaminating articles is by
thorough washing through several changes of strong soap and water.
Contaminated clothing should not be worn again until thoroughly
washed. It should not be washed with other clothes, and care should
be taken to rinse thoroughly any implements used in washing.</p>

<p>Dogs and cats can be decontaminated in the same manner; precaution
should be taken, however, to avoid being poisoned in doing
the washing. It is likely that most &ldquo;dry cleaning&rdquo; processes will
remove any contaminant; but there is always danger that clothing
sent to commercial cleaners may cause poisoning to unsuspecting
employees.</p>

<p>Certain prophylactic inoculations for the prevention of ivy poisoning
have been developed and used with limited success; such treatment,
however, should be administered by a physician only. The
theory that eating a few leaves of these poisonous plants will confer
immunity is without foundation; it should not be attempted even
as an experiment, because very serious poisoning is likely to result.</p>

<p>There seems to be no absolute quick cure for ivy poisoning for all
individuals, even though many studies have been made to devise
effective remedies. Remedies may be helpful in removing the poisonous
principle or rendering it inactive and for giving some relief
from the irritation. Mild poisoning usually subsides within a few
days, but if the inflammation is severe or extensive a physician should
be consulted. Self-treatment also has other dangers, as the symptoms
of ivy poisoning may be confused with those of other conditions
and harm may be done by improper treatment. In all cases the
safest procedure is to consult a physician.</p>

<p>Some tried remedies are effective on certain individuals and ineffective
on others. Sometimes a person will find one remedy effective
and later, to his surprise, get very little relief from it. A large
number of patent medicine remedies of doubtful value are commonly
offered for sale. The following are more or less standard measures
that have been advocated by different individuals and found helpful
in certain cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span></p>

<p>The United States Public Health Service recommends a 10 percent
alcoholic solution of tannic acid applied as a lotion. It is stated
that in using it the tops of the blisters should be rubbed off with
sterile gauze saturated with the solution and that any large blisters
should be opened with a sterile instrument. The treatment should
be repeated three or four times at 6-hour intervals. A modified form
of this treatment recommends vigorous rubbing of the lesions with
alcohol-soaked gauze to remove the tops of blisters, followed by
application of a 10 percent aqueous solution of tannic acid as a
lotion. Any treatment involving opening of blisters and the application
of alcohol is severe, and many cases requiring such treatment
should be handled by physicians.</p>

<p>One of the oldest well-established remedies is a fresh solution of
one 5-grain tablet of potassium permanganate dissolved in 1 quart
of water; concentrations as much as 5 percent, however, have been
used. The potassium permanganate is apparently active in neutralizing
any poison that may remain on the surface of the skin and it
has some therapeutic properties. This solution may be applied
freely to the irritated or contaminated skin, but the skin should be
rinsed with water a few minutes after the stronger solutions are
used. Applications should be repeated every hour or two. The
brown stain it causes on the skin will in time wear off, or it may be
removed with lemon juice. It more or less permanently stains
clothing.</p>

<p>Ferric chloride in combination with several other substances has
been used effectively by many people. One of the most common
formulas is that given under the discussion of precautions against
poisoning (<a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>). To this formula 1 to 3 percent of phenol is frequently
added to reduce the itching; however, not more than 1 percent
of phenol should ever be used without the advice of a physician,
on account of the danger of systemic absorption and poisoning. The
solution should be freely applied to the irritated or contaminated
skin every hour or two. Some instances of persistence of the brown
discoloration of the skin have been reported. For this reason its
use is limited, but for most individuals the discoloration completely
disappears after a few days. Stain on clothing is usually permanent.</p>

<p>Photographer&rsquo;s hypo solution has been used with good results in
many cases. This is a 10-percent solution of sodium thiosulfate in
water. The irritated or contaminated skin should be bathed in it
every hour or two. It does not stain skin or clothing.</p>

<p>A calamine lotion with the addition of about 2 percent of phenol
is often used and in many cases is effective. Frequent applications
are necessary. For some people it is effective in relieving the itching.
The pink stain is not permanent.</p>

<p>It is better to leave inflamed areas exposed to the air rather than
cover them with dressings. If poisoning is so severe that dressings
appear necessary, a physician should be consulted before any home
remedies are applied.</p>

<h2><a name="ERADICATION_OF_PLANTS" id="ERADICATION_OF_PLANTS">ERADICATION OF PLANTS</a></h2>


<p>Poison-ivy<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> can be killed either by mechanical means, such as digging,
or by applying chemical herbicides. The best modern herbicides
are so deadly to plants that a single treatment kills all the
leaves and 90 percent or more of the roots. This is the easiest and
least dangerous way to destroy these poisonous pests. There are
places, however, where chemicals cannot be used, as in hedges and
shrubbery where the poison-ivy is closely mixed with the valuable
plants. In such situations, hand-pulling is the only satisfactory
method. At times also chemicals and spraying equipment are not
available, and then the mattock, scythe, or plow must be resorted to.
Even with these simple tools some timing and handling methods are
better than others.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> For brevity, the single designation poison-ivy is used under this heading to apply
equally to all poison-ivies and to poison sumac.</p></div>


<h3><a id="CHEMICAL" name="CHEMICAL"></a>CHEMICAL WEED KILLERS</h3>

<p>By using care poison-ivy can be destroyed with chemicals without
danger of poisoning to the operator. Except in very heavy growth,
one may stand at a distance from the plants and apply the herbicide
without touching the leaves. Most chemicals are applied as a
spray solution, and many sprayers can be equipped with extension
nozzles 2 feet or more in length. The greatest danger of ivy poisoning
occurs from careless handling of gloves, shoes, and clothing after
finishing the work. Garments should be worn that can either be
destroyed after use or washed thoroughly in hot soda solution and
soapsuds.</p>

<p>The chemicals thus far found most satisfactory on poison-ivy are,
in approximate order of effectiveness, ammonium sulfamate, 2,4-D
(2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), ammonium thiocyanate, borax,
carbon disulfide, coal-tar creosote oil, fuel oil and similar petroleum
distillates, sodium chlorate, and sodium arsenite. Less effective
chemicals include common salt, kerosene, gasoline, calcium cyanamide,
ammonium sulfate, and iron sulfate.</p>

<p>Chemicals other than borax are best applied as a spray to the
foliage. Borax is scattered dry on the soil around the plants. Any
field or garden spray machine or even a sprinkling can is useful for
applying the liquids, but a common knapsack sprayer holding about
2 gallons is convenient and does not waste the solution, application
should be as a fine spray under moderate pressure rather than a driving
mist, since the object is to wet the leaves of the poison-ivy and
avoid wetting the leaves of desirable plants.</p>

<p>Most chemicals used on poison-ivy are injurious to the foliage of
all kinds of plants and must be applied with caution if the surrounding
vegetation is valuable. During the early part of the growing
season the leaves of the poisonous plants usually tend to stand conspicuously
apart from those of adjacent plants and can be treated
separately if sprayed with care. Later the leaves become intermingled
and injury to adjacent species is unavoidable. Chemicals
other than oil are not injurious to the thick bark of an old tree, and
poison-ivy clinging to the trunk can be safely sprayed with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span></p>

<p>Chemical sprays can be used at any time when poison-ivy is in
full leaf, June and July being perhaps the best months. Ordinarily
treatments should begin not later than August 15, as poison-ivy
then begins to go dormant and sprays are ineffective.</p>

<p>Best results are obtained both with sprays and with dry chemicals
when the soil is moist but not wet at time of treatment. Borax can
well be applied just before a rain, but sprayed chemicals are likely
to be washed off if rain falls within 24 hours. One gallon of spray
solution is sufficient to cover all the leaves on 1 square rod (272 square
feet) of dense poison-ivy, or 2 to 4 square rods of a scattered stand.</p>

<p>Sprays give best results when applied in early morning or late
afternoon when the air is cool and moist. Spraying in the middle
of a dry, hot day is likely to be disappointing unless the plants are
in deep shade.</p>

<p>No method of chemical eradication can be depended upon to kill
all the plants in a stand of poison-ivy with one application. Three
to four light retreatments made as soon as the new leaves are fully
expanded are always necessary (1) to destroy plants missed the first
time, (2) to treat new growth from the old roots, and (3) to destroy
seedlings. At least three and sometimes four treatments at intervals
of 2 to 8 weeks are necessary before all plants are dead. These followup
treatments do not require much time or material, but neglect of
them may easily lead to serious reinfestation.</p>

<p>Poison-ivy has an annoying habit of &ldquo;playing possum.&rdquo; Plants
believed dead sometimes revive after many months. Thus an area
under treatment must be watched closely for at least a year if complete
eradication is to be assured.</p>

<p>Dead foliage and steins remaining after the plants have been killed
with chemicals are only slightly poisonous, but to avoid difficulty the
dead stems should be cut off and burned.</p>

<p><b>Ammonium sulfamate.</b>&mdash;This chemical, under a proprietory name,
has come on the market recently as a weed killer and has proved
especially useful against poison-ivy. Ammonium sulfamate is not
dangerous to use under ordinary conditions, is not harmful to the soil,
and is not flammable. It is slowly corrosive to metals, and spray
equipment should be washed thoroughly with a solution of lime
or soda immediately after use. Like salt, ammonium sulfamate absorbs
moisture from the air and must be stored in a dry place.</p>

<p>Ammonium sulfamate is dissolved in water at the rate of 12 ounces
per gallon and sprayed on the leaves until they are wet but not dripping.
The foliage begins to wilt within 21 hours, but the action is
slow, and a week or more may elapse before the leaves die. Some
new growth may be expected after 4 to 8 weeks, and this should be
sprayed as soon as the new leaves are fully expanded. Two or occasionally
three such retreatments are needed before the kill is complete.</p>

<p><b>2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid).</b>&mdash;This chemical under the
abbreviated name 2,4-D, or DCP, is a recent addition to the list of
effective weed killers and may become an important weapon for use
against poison-ivy. It should not be confused with DDT or DD, two
other new agricultural chemicals, the first an insecticide and the
second used as a soil fumigant. Under wartime restrictions the use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
of 2,4-D was very limited, but its prospective value is so great that
those interested in the control of poison-ivy should be informed
about it.</p>

<p>The chemical 2,4-D is one of the so-called &ldquo;plant hormones,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;growth regulators.&rdquo; In minute quantities it stimulates some of the
plant functions, but in slightly larger dosage it is toxic. A solution
consisting of one-seventh ounce in 1 gallon of water sprayed on
poison-ivy foliage kills all leaves hit and may kill the roots. In the
concentration used in weed killing 2,4-D is not believed to be harmful
to animal life, but until this point can be thoroughly clarified the
chemical should be used with reasonable caution to avoid poisoning.
2,4-D is not flammable and is not corrosive to spray machinery. If
the sprayer is used also for insecticides and fungicides it must be
washed very thoroughly to remove the slightest trace of the 2,4-D.
This is very difficult, however; it is safer to use another sprayer.</p>

<p>To make a spray solution 2,4-D must be combined with other
chemicals, as it is not soluble in water. A number of substances, including
polyethelene glycols and naphthenic soaps, have been used
for this purpose, but the best solvent has not yet been determined.
Commercial weed killers containing 2,4-D are of varying composition.</p>

<p><b>Ammonium thiocyanate.</b>&mdash;This byproduct of the coal-gas industry
is one of the newer herbicides. The crude commercial chemical is
a pink or reddish salt, very soluble in water. It does not keep well,
tends to disintegrate into a red, sludgy mass, and is difficult and
disagreeable to handle. A purer form in clean white crystals is
available and is well worth the slight extra cost. In either form
ammonium thiocyanate is injurious to the skin and to leather articles,
and in time it corrodes metals. The spray solution is made by dissolving
1 to 1&frac12; pounds of ammonium thiocyanate in 1 gallon of
water.</p>

<p>Most annual, plants and some perennials are killed by a single
application of ammonium thiocyanate. Poison-ivy usually requires
three or four treatments. Ammonium thiocyanate has a high content
of nitrogen, much of which remains in the soil and eventually
becomes a fertilizer. Thus an area treated with this chemical is
likely to produce a profuse growth of annual weeds a month or two
after treatment.</p>

<p><b>Borax.</b>&mdash;Common borax scattered on the soil is deadly to the roots
of many plants. Spread dry at the rate of 10 to 15 pounds per square
rod, it kills poison-ivy slowly over a period of 6 to 8 weeks. A second
somewhat lighter treatment 3 to 5 months later is usually necessary to
kill all plants completely.</p>

<p>Borax is easy to handle, nonpoisonous, and nonflammable, readily
obtainable, and not expensive. It is one of the best chemicals to use
around stone walls, rocky ledges, fences, and other inaccessible places.</p>

<p>Plants differ greatly in their resistance to borax. Some species,
as Virginia creeper and deep-rooted trees, do not seem to be injured,
but others, notably dogwood, are very sensitive to it. Until more
complete information is available as to the effect of borax on other
plants, it should be employed on poison-ivy only where possible
damage to surrounding vegetation is not objectionable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span></p>

<p><b>Carbon disulfide.</b>&mdash;The fumes of this pungent, volatile liquid are
very poisonous to plants, and the chemical is widely used in the
West to kill deep-rooted perennial weeds. When poison-oak, particularly,
is growing in a mixture with wild morning-glory (bind-weed)
or similar noxious weeds, both plants may often be killed
at one operation by treating the soil with carbon disulfide. Holes
ordinarily 6 inches deep and 18 inches apart in all directions are
punched in the soil with a 1-inch iron bar, and 2 ounces of carbon
disulfide are poured in each hole. The openings are closed immediately
with a wooden club. This dosage equals 20 pounds of the
chemical per square rod. Carbon disulfide is likely to be less effective
on shallow-rooted than on deep-rooted plants and is therefore
of limited value against poison-ivy, which is surface-rooted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Carbon disulfide is poisonous, and as it is also highly
flammable it should be handled as carefully as gasoline.</b></p></div>

<p><b>Coal-tar creosote oil.</b>&mdash;In the fractional distillation of coal, many
oils and oillike substances are obtained, some of which are very toxic
to plants. The most common and usually the cheapest is the creosote
used for wood preservation. This substance has great penetrating
power and is an excellent herbicide on woody plants like poison-ivy.
Ordinarily creosote oil is too expensive to use alone and is therefore
mixed with some kind of petroleum oil. A mixture of 75 percent
fuel oil and 25 percent creosote oil is almost as effective as straight
creosote and is made at one-third the cost. Two applications of this
mixture at an interval of about 6 weeks usually kill a high percentage
of poison-ivy. Creosote is not selective and kills all plants
alike.</p>

<p><i>Fuel oil (Diesel and similar oils).</i>&mdash;Crude petroleum is refined into
many kinds of oil, and those corresponding to fuel oil. Diesel
oil, stovetop oil, and orchard-heating oil are more injurious to plants
than crude oil itself or the higher distillates, such as gasoline and
kerosene. Fuel oils are widely used for destroying vegetation, particularly
by highway departments in States having oil resources.
When sprayed on poison-ivy, fuel oil brings about a slow but fairly
sure death of the plants. Two or three applications may be necessary
before the roots are killed. Fuel oil, like creosote, must be used with
care around valuable trees and shrubs because it penetrates the bark
and kills or injures all species. As used for poison-ivy spraying
there is no injury to the soil. The oil-soaked vegetation is flammable.</p>

<p><b>Sodium chlorate.</b>&mdash;Sodium chlorate is the standard herbicide for
killing deep-rooted perennial weeds like bindweed, but when used
as a spray, it is a dangerous fire hazard, and when applied dry, it
sterilizes the soil for 2 to 4 years. Where sterilization of the soil is
desirable or not objectionable, one application of the dry chemical,
evenly at the rate of 3 to 4 pounds per square rod, is sufficient for a
complete kill.</p>

<p>If used as a foliage spray on poison-ivy, the chemical is dissolved
in water at the rate of 8 to 12 ounces per gallon. The leaves are
killed within a few hours, but the plants are likely to make a strong
new growth and may require as many as six treatments before they
cease to produce new leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Sodium chlorate mixed with wood, cloth, or other
organic materials is highly combustible and easily
ignited. Shoes and clothing on which chlorate solution
has been allowed to dry are especially dangerous, for they
will ignite and burn with explosive fury. Contaminated
clothing should be kept wet until thoroughly washed in
a large volume of water. Chlorate should be stored only
in original metal containers, as any admixture of chlorate,
wet or dry, with straw, wood, dust, cloth, or leather has
properties similar to those of gunpowder or matches.</b></p></div>

<p><b>Sodium arsenite.</b>&mdash;Sodium arsenite is one of the most powerful
plant poisons known and is widely used for sterilizing soil on railroads,
roadways, and other places where no vegetation of any kind
is desired. It is relatively inexpensive. In normal times sodium
arsenite is obtainable in both powder and liquid form. In weak
solution (4 to 6 ounces per gallon of water) the chemical can be
used as a spray to destroy poison-ivy. Like sodium chlorate spray,
it kills the leaves but not the roots, and five or six treatments may be
required. The solution kills the leaves of all plants impartially and
will also kill the young tender bark of shrubs and trees. This may
be either an advantage or a disadvantage, depending upon circumstances.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>All compounds containing arsenic are deadly poisons
if taken internally. Arsenical sprays and chemicals
should not be used where there is any possibility that
materials sprayed with them will be eaten by animals or
man. In some communities special permission must be
obtained before arsenical weed killers may be used.</b></p></div>


<h3><a id="MECHANICAL" name="MECHANICAL"></a>ERADICATION BY MECHANICAL MEANS</h3>

<p>Poison-ivy can be grubbed out by hand quite readily early in
spring and late in fall. When the ground is soft after rains the roots
come out in long pieces. Grubbing when the soil is dry and hard is
almost futile, since the roots break off in the ground, leaving large
pieces that later sprout vigorously. Eradication by grubbing is permanent
if well done. Because of his close contact with the plants,
the person doing the grubbing should have a high degree of immunity
to ivy-poisoning. Many people are not so immune as they believe,
and it is common sense to wear leather gloves with gauntlets and a
shirt with long sleeves. If care is taken to prevent the poison-ivy
from touching the face, and if the clothes, including the gloves, are
burned or thoroughly washed after use, severe poisoning may be
avoided.</p>

<p>Poison-ivy vines climbing on trees should be severed at the base
and as much of the vine as possible pulled away from the tree. Often
the roots of the tree and weed are so intertwined that grubbing is
impossible without injury to the tree. Close mowing of the poison-ivy
shoots at frequent intervals is the only remedy. Roots and stems
removed in grubbing should be burned or otherwise destroyed, since
the dry material is almost as poisonous as the fresh. Care must be
taken to keep out of the smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span></p>

<p>Old plants of poison-ivy produce an abundance of seeds, and these
are freely disseminated, especially by birds. A poison-ivy seedling
2 months old usually has a root that one mowing will not kill. Seedling
plants at the end of the first year have well-established underground
runners that only grubbing or chemicals will kill. Seedlings
are a constant threat as long as old poison-ivy is in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Plowing is of little value in combating poison-ivy unless followed
by persistent stirring with a cultivator or harrow, to keep all roots
loosened from the soil. Otherwise plowing merely propagates the
weed.</p>

<p>Mowing with a scythe or sickle is a common method of attacking
poison-ivy, but it has little effect on the roots unless frequently repeated.
The number of cuttings required to kill depends upon the
age of the plants and the size of the roots, but is seldom less than
four. New shoots should be cut as soon as the first leaf on each stem
is full size. Cutting either earlier or later delays eradication.</p>

<p>Weed burners are implements resembling oversize blowtorches.
Two types are manufactured, one producing a short, hot, blue flame
and the other a long smoky-yellow flame. Both are useful for destroying
foliage. Neither is likely to kill perennial plants like poison-ivy
at one operation, even though the flame is held on the weeds for
a minute or more until leaves and stems are completely incinerated.
The roots are not injured by this, and new leafy shoots soon develop.
A better plan is to &ldquo;sear&rdquo; the plants by passing the flame slowly
over the vines just long enough to sear or wilt the leaves, but not
long enough to burn them. The roots appear to be injured more by
&ldquo;searing&rdquo; than completely burning the leaves, and the operation
is quicker and cheaper. Three to four searings when the leaves reach
full size usually kill the roots.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
